# 1. Assignment 1 
## WEBSITE CLONE PROJECT:
** Objective: ** Utilize your HTML and CSS skills to recreate the landing page of a website of your choice. This project is an opportunity to deepen your understanding of web design and development. 

## Task Details:
1. Selection of Website: Choose a website with a landing page that you find visually appealing and technically interesting. Ensure that your chosen website is complex enough to challenge you, but not so advanced that it becomes unmanageable with your current skill set.
2. Analysis and Planning:
• Structure and Design: Analyse the structure of the website’s landing page. Identify the HTML elements used and their arrangement. Consider the page layout, navigation elements, headers, footers, and any unique sections.
• Styling: Pay attention to the CSS properties that contribute to the visual design. Note the fonts, colours, spacing etc.
• Developer Tools: Use the browser's developer tools to inspect the page. This can provide insights into the HTML structure and CSS styles. For example, Chrome's CSS Overview can reveal details about fonts and colour schemes used.

3. Development:
• HTML: Create the HTML structure based on your analysis. Use semantic HTML to ensure your code is accessible and meaningful.
• CSS: Apply CSS to style your page. Try to replicate the original design as closely as possible.
• Focus on Visual Design: Your task is to replicate the visual design and layout. You are not expected to recreate any backend functionality or add additional pages. Interactive elements should be limited to what can be achieved with HTML and CSS
(e.g., hover effects). 

## Stretch Goal:
Try to implement responsiveness into your design with media queries.
